## Game Description

Multi-networked Street Fighter platform fighter using physics engine to fight with our favorite programming languages. A throwback that lets us literally fight it out with our top programming languages. Design will resemble the game Street-Fighter while gameplay will resemble Super Smash Bros.

## Advanced Topic Description

### Physics Engine

Physics engine will simulate movement and collisions in a rigid-body format. Basic principles of kinematics will be applied for interactions to allow movement on an XY plane. This includes concepts such as gravity, momentum, etc. Hardware efficiency will be essential to reduce lag and maintain functional gameplay across networks.
    
### Multiplayer Network

Creating the ability for players to fight one another across a network. 

## Midterm Goals

* Characters can move with keyboard input
* Characters will not collide
* Network multiplayer started
* Physics engine started

## Final Goals

* 15%: Networking
* 15%: Physics Engine
* 10%: Keyboard Input Working
* 10%: Health Logic Functional
* 12.5%: Combat Hits and Collisions Detected
* 12.5%: 1 Character, 1 Stage

## Stretch Goals

* Welcome Screen and Menus
* Impact-Based Sound Effects
