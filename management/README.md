# CS1666 Managment Weeks

Each team will need to construct a Markdown file to note who will manage the
team for each management week. If your team does not have enough members to
staff all weeks, you can list "NONE" for any unused management week. Each
student must be a manager for a single week. A template form for end of
managment week reports can be found in `TEMPLATE_mgmt_report__NAME.yaml`.
Before sending a copy to me, rename it so as to remove the "TEMPLATE" and
change "NAME" to your name. Each team member's Effort rating should be on the
following scale:

* -2: No effort or next-to no effort
* -1: Insufficient effort
* 0: Sufficient effort
* 1: Extra effort
* 2: Overwhelming effort

I will be happy if everyone earns a 0 for each week all term, and will be
unhappy if there are alot of -2's and +2's earned (both indicate an imbalance
of effort).
