# Networking

## Choices
+ **UDP vs TCP**
  + Why UDP
+ **P2P	vs Authoritative Server**
  + P2P
  + Authoritative 
    + Process on Client Sice
    + Process on Server Side
## Rust Networking
+ **Net**
  + Overview of functions/opperations used
+ **Libc**
  + Why we needed it/what we used
+ **Server Pseudocode**
+ **Client Pseudocode**
+ **Where it gets Complicated**
  + latency
  + types of information being passed
  + general issues faced

## Our Process
+ **Basic approach: Iterative process**
  + Steps we took
  + implementing networking into Farnan's examples
+ **Serialization for Structs**
  + what this is, how we used it
+ **Threads for Multiple, Concurrent Needs**
+ **Client Side Prediction**
  + latency
  + techniques used to account for this
+ **Port Forwarding**
  + How we where able to run this over a network
